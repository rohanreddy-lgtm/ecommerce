# E-Commerce Application: Backend Web Development Project

### **Milestone 1: Project Overview**

**Brief Overview:**
This project involves developing a fully functional e-commerce platform utilizing the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The application will be built using React's Create React App (CRA) for the front-end, MongoDB as the database solution, and Node.js with Express to handle the back-end server operations.

The project will be split into two main areas: **Frontend** (client-side) and **Backend** (server-side) development. 

- **Frontend:** We will be creating various pages for user interaction, including:
  - **Login Page**
  - **Sign Up Page**
  - **Forgot Password Page**
  - **Home Page**
  - **Product Display Page**
  - **Cart Page**
  - **Address Page**
  - **Payment Page**
  - **Order Confirmation Page**
  - **Order History Page**
  - **Help Page**
  - **Error Page**
  - Detailed Product Pages

- **Backend:** The server will interact with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to handle data management. We will be using the Mongoose library to interact with the database and define schemas for data consistency. To manage communication between the front-end and the back-end, we will implement APIs that allow for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using HTTP methods like `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.

We’ll integrate **bcrypt** for password hashing to ensure user data security, and the entire project will follow best practices for backend structure, focusing on scalability and maintainability.

### Milestone 2: Frontend Development (Login Page)**

For this milestone, we successfully created the **Login Page** using React's Create React App (CRA). To improve the user interface and design, we will be updating the layout with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and incorporate **React-Icons** for intuitive icons. Tailwind CSS will help us streamline the design process with its utility-first classes, making the UI responsive and visually appealing.


Product Management System – Milestone 12

In this milestone, we’ll create an API endpoint to retrieve all products filtered by a user’s email and send that data to the frontend.

We will also build a function in the frontend to fetch this filtered data and display it dynamically using the ProductCard component.

Why This Milestone is Important

Understanding Data Filtering: Learn how to filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., user email) and send only relevant data to the frontend.


Dynamic Data Handling: Enhance your ability to retrieve and display data dynamically using React components.




### Milestone 3: Backend Structure and Initial Setup**

At this stage, we’ve laid the foundation for the backend by setting up the directory structure for the project. The backend is structured as follows:

- **`src/` Directory:** Contains all source code files for the server.
  - **`config/`**: Stores environment configuration files like `.env` for MongoDB URL and the server port.
  - **`controllers/`**: Defines functions to handle incoming requests for various routes.
  - **`database/`**: Contains the MongoDB connection logic in `db.js`.
  - **`middleware/`**: Houses custom middleware functions such as `error.js` for centralized error handling.
  - **`model/`**: Contains Mongoose models for the database schema.
  - **`routers/`**: Defines route handlers for different API endpoints.
  - **`utils/`**: Stores utility functions, including the `ErrorHandler.js` to manage application-level errors.

In the **`index.js`** file, we imported Express, initialized the app, and set up basic routing and server listening. We can now handle HTTP requests through `app.get` and set the server to listen for incoming requests on the specified port.

### Milestone 4: Backend Structure and Initial Setup**
creating user model, user controller and Multer support

### Milestone 6
: Backend Structure and Initial Setup**
Password Encryption and User Data Storage

Practical Experience with Filtering: This skill is essential for real-world applications, like showing only products created by a specific user.

Steps for Milestone 12
    
  Backend: Writing the Endpoint to Retrieve Filtered Product Data

We’ll create a GET endpoint that fetches all products associated with a specific user’s email from the database.



Frontend: Fetching Filtered Data from the Backend


Implement bcrypt to hash the user's password during the signup process.
Ensure that the hashed password is stored in the database instead of the plaintext version to enhance security.
User Data Storage:

Save all relevant user information (e.g., name, email, etc.) in the database.
Maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the password by ensuring it remains encrypted throughout the process.

### Milestone 7
Create Login Endpoint:

Accept user credentials (email/username and password).
Retrieve the corresponding user from the database.
Validate Password:

Use bcrypt to hash the entered password.
Compare it with the stored hashed password for authentication.

## Milestone 8
In this milestone we created two components called Home.jsx and productcard.jsx. product card.jsx is the template used in home.jsx to map out all the products and display them. We also added routes to the home.jsx to display it when the page loads. Based on the number of products the products are mapped and displayed.

## Milestone 9 - Product Form Creation

**Overview**

In this milestone, I created a product form designed to collect all necessary details for new products. This form is essential for inputting data that will be stored in the MongoDB database and displayed on the product page, which was made in the previous milestone.

**Steps Taken**

**Form Development**: I designed and implemented a user-friendly form that allows for the input of multiple products, images along with other relevant product details such as name price description catagory tags... etc.

For this milestone I mostly worked on the frontend of the project. I created a new file named as the productform.jsx.

## Milestone 10

In this milestone I created a schema for products. I made this using a new js file in the Model folder named Productmodel.js. In this I used mongoose to make the schema. I also created a new file called Products.js when I have all the program for initiating a post request that will store all the data in the database. I also used the middleware Multer to process and use the image files that would be uploaded of the product.I have made the neccessary changes to the middleware folder and Index.js to work as intended.

## Milestone 11 and 12

In this milestone we bridged the gap between the frontend and the backend of the productform by connecting it to mongoDB. In the first milestone we made changes to products.js to use the get router to find the data in mongo db and pass it forward to home.jsx where it would then be displayed to show the products that are present on the database. In milestone 2 we were supposed to use nodemailer but it was not done as our mentor said it was unneccesary. Then we made changes to the post router to make the form functional and make it upload new products to the database.

## Milestone 13
In this milestone we made the endpoint for updation. We use the put request to carry it out. In the frontedn we added the delete and edit buttons for editing and deleteing. Also since it should only be visible to the seller we made a whole new productcard.jsx for sellers.

## Milestone 14
added an functionality to delete button to the product data and write and backend endpoint to delete the product with the use of ID. Also fixed some of the other bugs I faced which were causing unexpected behaviours and made the routing much more clear.

## Milestone 15
In this milestone I created a new navbar that renders on all the pages. I added Navlinks for Home, productform, login and signup. I first made a new jsx file called navbar and then created the whole navbar. I also styled it using Tailwind css. I also had other issues that I fixed in home.jsx and styled productform jsx as it had no styling before.

## Milestone 16
Created singleproduct.jsx. The pages is made to show details about the product. I also routed it and made other minor changes.

## Milestone 17 & 18
In these two Milestones we first added the cart details to the schema. Then we also created a post request for sending the details and storing them on the database. We also created an endpoint to receive request from cart page.

On the frontend, we’ll create a function to call the new API endpoint and fetch products for a specific user email.

 Creating the Product Card Component
 
This component will display each product’s details, just like in previous milestones.

How This Works

Backend: The GET endpoint filters the products in MongoDB by the userEmail field and returns the results.

Frontend: The fetchUserProducts function fetches the filtered data based on the provided email.

Dynamic Rendering: The data is passed to the ProductCard component, which renders a card for each product that belongs to the specified user.
