Product Management System – Milestone 12

In this milestone, we’ll create an API endpoint to retrieve all products filtered by a user’s email and send that data to the frontend.

We will also build a function in the frontend to fetch this filtered data and display it dynamically using the ProductCard component.

Why This Milestone is Important

Understanding Data Filtering: Learn how to filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., user email) and send only relevant data to the frontend.

Dynamic Data Handling: Enhance your ability to retrieve and display data dynamically using React components.

Practical Experience with Filtering: This skill is essential for real-world applications, like showing only products created by a specific user.

Steps for Milestone 12
    
  Backend: Writing the Endpoint to Retrieve Filtered Product Data

We’ll create a GET endpoint that fetches all products associated with a specific user’s email from the database.


Frontend: Fetching Filtered Data from the Backend

On the frontend, we’ll create a function to call the new API endpoint and fetch products for a specific user email.

 Creating the Product Card Component
 
This component will display each product’s details, just like in previous milestones.

How This Works

Backend: The GET endpoint filters the products in MongoDB by the userEmail field and returns the results.

Frontend: The fetchUserProducts function fetches the filtered data based on the provided email.

Dynamic Rendering: The data is passed to the ProductCard component, which renders a card for each product that belongs to the specified user.
